# Portfolio in Progress

This is my public work repository.  
I have worked on private projects in GitLab during my professional experience at **DtrueStar**, but due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot publish that code.  

I am currently building this portfolio to showcase my skills in **Next.js, TypeScript, Motion, HTML5, CSS3**, and other visual-focused libraries.  
I also have knowledge and experience in **backend development** using tools like **Django** and working with both **SQL and NoSQL databases**, such as **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**.

Stay tuned â€” more projects coming soon!
